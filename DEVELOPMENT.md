# Porsche Design System - Visual Regression Tester

Export functions to create visual regression tests.

## Using the Visual Regression Tester

### Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) ([see below](#docker-installation-steps))

### Getting started

1. Clone [`visual-regression-tester` repository](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-visual-regression-tester)
1. Switch to **project root directory**
1. Checkout branch **master** by executing `git checkout master`
1. Execute command `npm login --registry=https://porscheui.jfrog.io/porscheui/api/npm/npm/`
1. Enter username, password (Artifactory API Key, **not** Artifactory password!) and e-mail address when asked in terminal
1. Execute `cat ~/.npmrc`, find following line `//porscheui.jfrog.io/porscheui/api/npm/npm/:_authToken=` and copy the generated _npm registry token_ from the file to your clipboard
1. Create an `.env` file within **project root directory** (never push this file to Git because it will contain secrets – by default it's ignored by `.gitignore`)
1. Add _npm registry token_ in following format `PORSCHE_NPM_REGISTRY_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE`
1. Make sure that Docker app is running

1. Run `./docker.sh run-install` - this may take up to several minutes at first start depending on your internet connection

_Note: `./docker.sh run-install` should be executed after every pull._

### Setup prettier

1. Go to Webstorm `Preferences`
1. Click on the Plugins tab and search for `prettier`
1. Install prettier
1. In `Preferences` go to `Languages and Frameworks` -> `Javascript` -> `Prettier`
1. Set `Prettier Package` to `{PATH_TO_YOUR_DIRECTORY}/node_modules/prettier`
1. Change `Run for files` to `{js,ts,jsx,tsx,vue,scss,json,css,html}`
1. Click checkbox `on save` and apply
1. You should be good to go.
1. If you have to exclude code fom being prettified, see [Prettier configuration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#javascript)

### Docker installation steps

1. Register your Docker account on [Hub-Docker](https://hub.docker.com)
1. Download Docker app locally on your machine and login
1. Start Docker

### Start

1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-start` (starts test server for visual-regression-tester itself)

### Build

1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-build` (builds releasable visual-regression-tester npm package)

### Test

1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-test` (executes test for visual-regression-tester)

---

## Dependency updates

Every week, we update our NPM packages:

1. Switch to __project root directory__
1. Run `./docker.sh run-upgrade`
   This should output the dependencies you might want to update. Select the NPM dependencies to be updated and press
   _Enter_. Afterwards execute automated tests to make sure application still works.
1. Run `./docker.sh run-test`

---

## Get Visual Regression Tester up & running within in application

__It's highly recommended to execute the visual regression tester within a Docker container to get reliable tests
results across any operating system and machine.__

## Installation

* Be sure that your project is configured to be able to install npm packages from Porsche UI Artifactory instance
* run `npm install --save-dev @porsche-design-system/visual-regression-tester`
  or `yarn add --dev @porsche-design-system/visual-regression-tester`

## How to start

Check out
the [Basic integration example](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-visual-regression-tester/tree/master/examples/basic-integration)
for an example how to get the visual regression tester up and running.

## API

### VisualRegressionTester

#### Constructor

The constructor expects 2 parameters:

* `browser: Browser`
* `options: VisualRegressionTestOptions` (_optional_)

Browser should be
a [Puppeteer Browser instance](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.9.0/docs/api.md#class-browser). Check
the basic integration example
for [how to create a Puppeteer browser](https://github.com/porscheui/porsche-visual-regression-tester/blob/master/examples/basic-integration/vrt/example-test.spec.ts#L19)
.

#### test() Method

In the actual visual regression test you have to call
the `test(snapshotId: string, scenario: Function, options: TestOptions = {elementSelector: '', maskSelectors: [], regressionSuffix: ''})`
-method in your expect block, taken a unique name of the reference shot as **first parameter** (`snapshotId: string`).

As **second parameter** (`scenario: Function`) within the scenario callback function you call the `goTo()` method with
the extended URL (will be concatinated with the `baseURL`), as well as `click()`, `hover()`, `focus()` and `type()` if
necessary and prepare the state to compare.
`goTo()`, `click()`, `hover()`, `focus()` and `type()` method accept following optional
parameters `networkIdleTimeout: number` and `maxInflightRequests: number` which means, — consider loading has finished
when there are no more than `maxInflightRequests` network connections for at least `networkIdleTimeout` ms.

As a **third and optional parameter** (`options: TestOptions`) you can pass following options:

* `elementSelector: string = ''` - pass a css selector for the element (selector is allowed to match exactly one element
  only) that should be included in your visual regression test.
* `maskSelectors: string[] = []` - pass a string array which includes css selectors for the elements that should be
  ignored in your visual regression test. If `maskSelectors` is used in combination with `elementSelector` then those
  two selectors are concatenated automatically to match elements nested in `elementSelector`.
* `regressionSuffix: string = ''` - pass a string to add a suffix in regression filenames

To make use of Puppeteers Page instance within the `scenario: Function` you call the `getPage()` method and apply any
supported Puppeteer method like `click()`, `hover()` or `type()`.

### VisualRegressionTestOptions

* `viewports` selects the viewports of your browser
* `deviceScaleFactor` specify device scale factor (can be thought of as dpr)
* `fixturesDir` directory where the reference-shots will be saved
* `resultsDir` directory where the diffing- and the regression-shots will be saved
* `tolerance` gives the tolerance range for your visual regression diffs
* `baseUrl` the base URL of the page you would like to test
* `timeout` impacts the timeout limit of page load
* `mode` defines the method with which the height for snapshot is determined

*Note*: All the VisualRegressionTestOptions are optional, those are the default options:

   ```
   viewports: [320, 480, 760, 1000, 1300, 1760]
   deviceScaleFactor: 1
   fixturesDir: 'vrt/fixtures'
   resultsDir: 'vrt/results'
   tolerance: 0
   baseUrl: 'http://localhost'
   timeout: 30000
   mode: 'auto'
   ```

## Notes:

* It might be necessary to increase the Jasmine timeout in order to get reliable test results.

* Add your `resultsDir` folder to `.gitignore` in order to not spam git history.

## What to do when tests are failing

* Switch to your `resultsDir` directory. Here you can find the belonging `diff` and `regression` images.
* Check if you would like to accept the changes
  * **If yes**: Replace the reference shot in the `fixturesDir` folder with the belonging one in the `resultsDir` folder
    and delete the images in the `resultsDir` directory afterwards manually.
  * **If no**: Recheck your code and run the tests again, when you think you fixed it.
